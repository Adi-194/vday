            "The Naru date(?)- Ahh how do I greet her when she comes? A side hug perhaps? What do cool kids these days do? Anyway, we got in and it seems chill. She seems so easy to talk to as well. What ramen did I just order? Wait you're telling me we already spent 2 hours here? I still feel like there's so much to talk about. Would asking her if she wanted to go for dessert elsewhere be kinda creepy? Oh she's down, shit where do we go? Oh she's fixing her make up after a meal, bro I've only seen this in anime XD. Okay so dessert, do I even know the roads around here properly? She really seems to love her sister, she must be really close. Ah church street, not great memories but they say you need to go through this trial if you want good food sigh. Ok I said it, I wonder if she found that weird, lite XD. Oh she suggested Amintiri, I always wanted to go there! The bois gonna hate me for this XD. Time to drive back, I think she's a lot more comfortable now, I think I spoke for 20 minutes only in the 1 hour drive XD. Wow, okay how do I tell her I wanna do this again? We've got so much in common and I was so badly looking for someone to check out new places with. But she's definitely gonna think I'm asking her out right? I should just say- Lemme know if you wanna do this again sometime, and see how it goes.",
            "Oh I didn't expect her to keep in touch. I mean we did make plans to go to the reunion but I wonder if it'll happen. Wait did she just ask ME if we could go to Maki before meeting for reunion? I didn't expect it to happen so soon! Damn but there are still 15 days left and I also have my Sikkim trip :/. I'm really enjoying these little meme exchanges we're having daily. It should be fine if I bother her a little more right >_<? Brooo out of all days Maki had to shut down operations when we were going?? I knew I spent all my luck on getting Naru reservations. She seems so stressed with work too, this is so sad. At least she seems like shes got clubbing plans on Christmas. She even thought of inviting me out of courtesy, she's such a nice person ;-;. Am I getting a little attached? My day starts with looking forward to her message now. I've had crushes before but isn't this too fast? And this doesn't seem superficial like the ones before hmm. Lemme go meet the bois and get over her, it's never worked before, it never will. Okay, am I really doing this? I'm not even drunk, how did they convince me to do this fk. My hands are shaking, my new watch is beeping with high heart rate, well at least its working XD. Should I go to airplane mode now? I don't think I can deal with this stress. DID SHE JUST SAY YES?? Will I be able to sleep tonight?? It's time for reunion, how do I get through this day with everyone else around? How do I act nonchalant when she's looking so cute, what filter do I have on right now? At least she's got some friends to keep her distracted phew. Lemme just meet up with everyone at Indian bier house. Oh Ananya said she'll tag along, I wonder how Aditi feels about this. Wait did she just tell them she's coming with me? Dude isn't that kinda risky? But why am I so happy right now omg. I keep looking at her across the table, will anyone find out? A compatibility reading? Bro I don't think I can handle a bad reading pls no. Time to leave huh, well we do have plans for Maki tomorrow... right? Might be hard now that we met today. I'll just drop her back and we'll see. I really wanna ask her if she wanted to get ice cream or something quickly before I drop her off. I cant believe she beat me to it, and we're also going on a long drive? Is this the first date now?? Bro I haven't prepared for this at all. Time went so fast and now I'm dropping her off. We spent so much time today, tomorrow's probably off, maybe I'd be asking for too much. She wants to meet?? And she said she likes me!!?? IDK my minds gonna shut off rn, good night.",
            "She looks so pretty in this pink top :o. It's kinda awkward but there's so much we need to talk about, I need to tell her so much about myself. This is the first time I'm going on a date, I need to know how she feels about so many things. I thought I'd never ask her with everything that's going on in her life with work, a possible relocation(?) yet here we are. This is such a nice looking cafeee. Damn I got way too distracted by the aesthetics of the place I forgot this is a date. The A-Z dating game? Why does this sound so interesting XD. We both never expected things would turn out this way but I'm so glad I asked. I wonder how many dates more will we go on before she says things wont work if she moves away. I wonder if she looks at this casually like everyone around me do. Maybe I should stop overthinking and enjoy this time that we have together. We're already walking back to the car :/. I can feel her shoulders brushing past mine, we're so close. I really wanna hold her hand rn. Maybe when we're about to cross the road I can use that as an excuse? ahh the moment's passed. I always thought I would never have regrets but this, this I definitely will. Maybe I should hint it right when she's about to get off?? Sounds cheap but whatever, I've come this far. So that's how my first ever date was huh... I could get used to this :)",
            "So we only have an hour today, so i'll keep this section short(not breaking the 4th wall :p). Bro my haircut didn't turn out the way I expected it too >_<. I wanted to get a good picture with her, I'm so tired stalking her Dubai stories and she doesn't even post on Insta sigh. Oh her sister called and we need to leave soon huh, hardly felt like we spoke, especially with all the questions she was supposed to have for me after talking to her friends XD. WTF COP, did you not find any other time to come? A sunday night? are you for real??",
            "And so you left for Mumbai, this is gonna be a long weekend, I've literally got no plans. I wonder if she'll send me updates hehe. Did she just sent me pictures? And this time I get to see it whenever I wanttt?? Is this the life I've been missing out on all along ;-;. It seems like shes having a lot of fun, that's great. I wonder if she'll think of me at all on this trip. She's with her aunt and sister and they've been looking forward to this for so long, I can't be so selfish. Oh she's done with her concert and she's pinging me, gosh this makes me so happy. Hmmm a deep conversation? (Ok from here on out i dont think i can describe everything i was feeling but i hope i was able to convey it back then XD). Girlfriend huh, who would have thought. Time for our first date night, she said these have higher weightage so I really hope she likes this place. Will she dress up for me?? I'm getting way too ahead of myself. Okay i think i just melted looking at her rn. I dont even know how to start the car, biggest fumble and the night hasn't even begun. So we talk about expectations, family.. ah I wonder how she felt about that. I've been thinking for the last entire week on how to have this conversation, i wonder if i was able to convey it properly. I will never forget this feeling of you grabbing my hand and resting your head on my shoulder. I would have enjoyed this moment had i not been worrying about how you took everything i just spoke about. Kaze was great but nothing could match the ride back home. I had forgotten everything and we just vibed the whole way back while holding hands. Such a bucketlist moment in my life i wonder if she'll ever understand. * Queues in Nights by Avichii *."
